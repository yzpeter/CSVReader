# CSVReader
This project is about using multi-threading to process large csv data set.
In this project, I used OpenMP. Total running time is around 1100 seconds on my laptop.
Please run "CSVReader.cpp" file. And you need to include "quote.csv" into the repo.

Process csv file and update statistics in real-time. No additional storage, space complexity is O(1).
Use C style fgets instead of C++ stdin, 50% faster.

Required packages: OpenMP, chrono
